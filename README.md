### Project Description
The Medicine Image Scanner with Audio Output is a user-friendly web application designed to scan images of medicines and provide detailed information in an audio format. This project aims to assist individuals, especially those with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory information, by converting scanned medicine images into clear, concise, and accurate audio descriptions.

### The Problem statement
 Blind and visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in verifying and understanding the medications they are prescribed. This issue is exacerbated by the reliance on visual labels and packaging, which are inaccessible to them. Current solutions, such as braille labels or text-to-speech tools, may not provide sufficient clarity or ease of use when it comes to identifying medications accurately.

### The Solution
There is a need for a solution that allows blind individuals to easily and independently verify the medicines they have been given. A website that accepts an image of a medicine and provides detailed suggestions and information about the medication through audio would empower blind people to understand what they are taking, ensure accuracy in their prescriptions, and reduce the risk of medication errors. This technology would not only enhance their independence but also improve their overall healthcare experience by providing accurate, accessible, and timely information in a format that they can trust.
